# Test Project

This is a **test project** page to verify Markdown rendering in the portfolio site.

- Written in MDX
- Supports embedded React components later on
- Metadata is stored as JSON inside front matter

You can even add inline JSX like:

```tsx
<div className="p-4 bg-blue-100 text-blue-900 rounded-xl">
  This is a JSX element rendered inside MDX!
</div>
