## Overview

This project is my personal developer portfolio, designed to highlight
real-world experience, maintainability, and performance.

## Key Features

- Static generation with Next.js App Router
- Semantic theming with CSS variables
- Reusable component architecture
- Content-driven project pages using MDX

## Technical Decisions

I chose MDX so I could mix rich Markdown content with React components
when needed (code blocks, callouts, media, etc.).

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add analytics
- Add automated Lighthouse checks
- Expand content with case-study metrics
